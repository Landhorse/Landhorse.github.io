    Nov17 is the latest track I've fully produced, and one I am incredibly proud of. While the name does indicate that I
    began working on this on November 17th, that is only when I wrote the main piano part. The track would sit in my
    hard drive for another month or two before I decided to pick it up again and build out the rest of the parts.

    The track was inspired by a Metro Boomin' studio session I was watching. Unfortunately, he didn't speak much about
    his process in the video, but he did show a montage of him creating a song. His starting with a piano melody swiftly
    prompted me to attempt the same.

    I started by picking four chords: F#m, C#m, Bm, and Db. The first three notes of each bar of the piano motif are an
    arpeggiated version of these chords, followed by transitional notes to get to the next chord. To enforce the key, I
    added a choir and a bass that simply played the chord and the root, respectively.

    After that, I transitioned to the drums. I'm very happy with how the drums turned out, as I feel I've struck a nice
    balance between simplicity and complexity. I actually created the drum kit from scratch, using Battery 4's samples
    to fill out my own custom drum rack. The reason I chose to use my own was a) to get the exact sounds I wanted, and
    b) to more easily pitch the drums. Although many think of drums as purely percussive, a drum with a static pitch can
    easily fall into the trap of being overly repetitive. For instance, my high hat rolls, which were once all in one
    pitch, now sound more vibrant and dynamic.

    Once the drums were done, I considered the chorus complete, and it was time to move on to the verses. One trap I
    often fall into while producing is being overly egalitarian with my parts. I want everything I write to be the lead,
    which often leads (no pun intended) to a muddy cacophony. So, for this song, I made sure not to overcast my
    performance. I pitched down the piano part, which removed a lot of its energy and brought in a subtle, somber
    string section. I also included a glockenspiel at the end of the verse, since I've never used one before.

    Lastly, I wrote the second and final verse. I stripped away the choir, as well as wrote a completely new drum part.
    I then added some tubular bells, which to me sound like old church bells. I pulled away from the drums for the last
    two
    bars and added in a glockenspiel since I've never used one before.

    All in all, this is one of my favorite pieces that I've written. The energic, melancholy feeling it envokes is
    hypnotic, almost like that of a lullaby. I do hope to put lyrics to this one day, but as of now, I don't have much
    to say that fits this mood.
