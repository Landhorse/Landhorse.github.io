    Sep12 was one of the first tracks I worked on this school year. It was a major step for me artistically, as I feel
    the drums on this song are dramatically better than the ones that came before. In addition, the process of making
    this song expanded my capabilities for creating synths in Massive X.

    The song had a few inspirations behind it. I had just watched a small music producer live stream on youtube, and his
    way of addressing drums motivated me to attempt my own style. Someone had also just played Drake and Future's song
    <em>Life is Good</em>, which inspired my use of ethereal chords over an active bass.
</p>

<p>
    So, I did just that. I decided to go for a simple i, iv, V pattern of Bm, Em, F#. While I could have gone for a more
    complex progression, I wanted the focus to be on other parts. I then wrote the bassline, starting with the root
    notes of the chords and then writing transitions to get to each of them. The final bassline is probably one of the
    most interesting and catchy basslines I have written.

    Next, I went on to the drums. I had a few goals in mind when it came to constructing my drum part. I did not want to
    have the high hats be the main focus, I wanted to have an active snare part, I wanted open high hats to be connected
    to the claps, and I wanted to avoid a kick drum on the first beat. What I ended up creating met all of these goals,
    and acts as something really unique. With this drumbeat, I can't immediately point to another song and say "It
    follows this pattern".

    After that, I got to work on the chorus synth, which I lovingly call "Children Screaming". I was listening to Conway
    The Machine's <em>Scatter Brain</em>, so when I found this preset, I tweaked it until it sounded like the children
    sampled in the Conway track. Similar to the kick drum, I knew I wanted to have the motif begin after beat one.
    Additionally, I wanted the melody to have a countering contour to the bassline, meaning when the bass goes up, I
    wanted the chorus lead to go down. I feel as though I've accomplished this successfully, creating a dueling part
    that can live with the bass.

    The last parts I wrote were the piano and its accompanying strings. Clearly written with a continuous thought, I
    was inspired by the dry, menacing piano used in Conway The Machine's <em>Bang</em>. Written originally for just the
    chorus, I wrote it to boost the bass, so it followed a similar progression. I had it switch its ending note every
    other repetition, creating a sense of tension and release. The strings are not intended to be noticed, but instead,
    help make the piano feel larger as the song builds up.

    I greatly enjoyed writing this piece. As aforementioned, I see this piece as a big milestone in my progress as a
    producer. There were many newbie techniques that I learned to let go of, and many professional techniques that I
    adopted into my style.
