        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">My plateau, and also, what defines my name"</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">There's something so poetic about the way he put those lines together. In so
                few words, he was able to illustrate the cycle of life, while at the same time begin the song. To pay
                homage, I separated my lines in the same way, dropping a reference to fellow 90s New York Rappers with
                "C.R.E.AM" (Cash Rules Everything Around ME", while also trying to convey a similar message. As Nas says
                later in the same song:</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">"But what's it all worth, can't take it with you under this Earth</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked</span></p>

        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">Before my number's called, history's made</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">Making choices, that determine my future under the sky</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?"</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">This is my spin on that same idea. And, like Nas did, I allude to the song
                title "All I Ask" in the second half.</span></p>

    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref3" id="cmnt3">[c]</a><span class="c4 c9">As aforementioned, this is was spawned
                the rest of the verse and song. While it doesn't look right on paper, when pronounced correctly,
                "adolescence", "adult lessons", "add all less than", and "a dull essence" all sound like the same word
                four times. This repetition creates familiarity for the listener, which has a soothing&nbsp;effect that
                makes them uneasy when its broken afterwards. Additionally, it should be noted that the perspective
                shifts a bit. The first for lines have a first person narrator "I", while the next for lines are
                addressing someone in second person "You". As for the meaning of the lines, while abstract, I'm alluding
                to how I felt as a child. To keep it brief, I was often a lone wolf, and didn't realize that there's not
                only no benefit to working alone, but at a certain point, it becomes an impossible battle being a one
                man army.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref4" id="cmnt4">[d]</a><span class="c4 c9">Again, here we A) break the
                repetition, but not before we say "adolescent" one more time, and B) switch to third person, and with
                that switch to a different, more direct storytelling style. The meaning of these lines builds on the
                last stanza: anyone who has seen me knows I don't have the most intimidating figure. This,
                unfortunately, lead to me not being taken as&nbsp;seriously as I thought I should, which lead me to be
                angry and spiteful. As the saying goes, success is the greatest revenge, so I tried my hardest to prove
                everyone wrong and show that my thoughts were valid.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref5" id="cmnt5">[e]</a><span class="c4 c9">To end the verse, I start by listing
                off some of my accomplishments that I used to prove myself. However, as the song says, it didn't make me
                feel complete, and as I explain in verse 2, it made me feel like an antagonist in someone else's story.
                Some wordplay is also slipped in here just for me to have some fun. An airplane, which is obviously is
                ridden, is grounded when the mission is a success. However, an airplane would also hit the ground if it
                were to go missing and run out of fuel. While a bit vague, trying to fit minor themes like this help
                streamline the writing by confining the meanings.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref6" id="cmnt6">[f]</a><span class="c4 c9">I'd actually came up with the
                generally idea of the chorus, and the song, for that matter, long before I wrote anything out. I didn't
                know exactly how it would go, but I wanted each line to descend&nbsp;in pitch and start with "All I
                ask"</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref7" id="cmnt7">[g]</a><span class="c4 c9">The general message of the chorus is:
                respect my success, help me when I'm down, but don't pity me and assume I can't do what I need to. If I
                can just get those few things from someone, I can consider them a good friend.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref8" id="cmnt8">[h]</a><span class="c4 c9">While verse 1 dealt with some heavy
                topics, I was a little disappointed with the lack of writing technique used. So, for verse 2, I set the
                goal to incorporate more wordplay and interesting rhyme schemes.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref9" id="cmnt9">[i]</a><span class="c4 c9">Here, I start a scheme with many words
                containing&nbsp;double meaning referring&nbsp;to cameras. From "take shots", to "give my development
                some exposure", I left very little room for words that didn't fit theme. As for the surface level
                meaning, I'm expressing how I feel as though people view my accomplishments as how I've acted my
                whole&nbsp;life, when in reality, I've had to work hard to get to where I'm at, and there was a point
                where I considered myself far behind on the curve.</span></p>

    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref10" id="cmnt10">[j]</a><span class="c4 c9">Here, I begin a very
                convoluted&nbsp;scheme involving running, chemicals, and politics, along with some other minor ones. To
                explain this, I'll dissect it line by line.</span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c4 c9">"Last place is the first place" is an oxymoron, as last and first are
                antonyms. It also begins a theme of running and racing. In "believed I'd be living", the
                pronunciation&nbsp;is stretched to make "believed" and "believing" sound the same. The whole line refers
                to me thinking that I would always be the rut of the pack.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref11" id="cmnt11">[k]</a><span class="c4 c9">"Fought tooth and nail, when my face
                had got hit with the hammer arm" also has a few meanings. The main meaning is that I had to dig deep,
                even when I was pushed down by others. Additionally, if you were to be punched in the face by a very
                large hand (or hammer arm), you would literally connect your tooth to a nail, in this case, their finger
                nail. Also, there's the more obvious connection between hammer and nail. Lastly, Arm &amp; Hammer is a
                brand that produces baking soda, a substance that runners used to ingest&nbsp;in order to run faster.
                Baking soda is also used as a cleaning agent for teeth. So, you would literally be fighting your teeth,
                or in this case, fighting the plaque on your teeth, and nail your race, if you hit your face with the
                Arm &amp; Hammer.</span></p>

    <div class="c8">
        <p class="c11"><a href="#cmnt_ref12" id="cmnt12">[l]</a><span class="c4 c9">Here, I continue both the story and
                the metaphor from before. When I was at my lowest, I realized I had to change, otherwise
                nothing&nbsp;would happen. To do this, I needed solid ground to stand on, but I also needed support from
                others, thus the "key of a city". In terms of the meanings, we need to connect with the Arm &amp; Hammer
                from before. Baking soda helps runners by reacting with the stomach acids to give you a boost. Thus,
                baking soda, acting as a "base", "changes" your body, when it is "mixed with a (ki) of (acid)y".</span>

                cycle of being behind, and now enjoy a reputation of succeeding. However, that reputation is a double
                edged sword, as now people always expect me to hit a mark, and are disappointed&nbsp;when I go under
                it.&nbsp; I threw in the word "chained" to end the chemical scheme. Additionally, the "win" and
                "marathon" reference also continue the running metaphor.</span></p>

                status now to where I was when I was younger. Additionally, "Mayor Ethan" is a homophone for "marathon"
                in the previous line. I end both the political&nbsp;and running metaphor with "running this
                town".</span></p>

                however, people have forgotten where I came&nbsp;from, and now only see me for where I am now. As is
                usually for this verse, I have a scheme running. In this case, I have an acting scheme, with "hero",
                "battle", "recast", "antagonist", and "act".</span></p>
